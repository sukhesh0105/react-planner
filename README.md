# My Daily Planner ğŸ“…

A small React project I built to manage daily tasks.  
You can add tasks with categories, mark them as complete, delete them, or clear everything.  
Tasks are saved in **localStorage**, so they stay even after refreshing.

## ğŸš€ Features
- Add new tasks with category (Work, Personal, Others)
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Clear all tasks
- Persist data in browser storage
- Shows todayâ€™s date

## ğŸ›  Tech Stack

## ğŸ“¦ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sukhesh0105/react-planner

npm install
npm start
